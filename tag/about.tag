      <p class = "about">I'm Alaina, a senior at <a href = "http://www.northwestern.edu/" class = "link">Northwestern University</a> who – according to her forthcoming diploma – studies computer science, but who has dabbled in art chemistry, linguistics, and medicine. In all my engineering pursuits, my background in the humanities & sciences has grounded me in empathy.</p>

      <p class = "about">Code and community have gone hand in hand throughout my engineering journey. For the past year, I have co-organized <a href = "http://eecs.northwestern.edu/wic/" class = "link">Women in Computing</a>, Northwestern's female engineering family. Currently, I'm planning the inaugural iteration of <a href = "https://twitter.com/nu_buildher" class = "link">BuildHer Hackathon</a>, Chicago's first-ever student-run women's hackathon, in order to introduce newcomers to coding and to promote the mixing of technology with other disciplines.</p>

      <p class = "about">Entrepreneurship, engineering, and research – I've done it all. Most recently, I mentored budding developers, gave talks, and fostered communities as a developer evangelist trainee at <a href = "https://www.clarifai.com/" class = "link">Clarifai</a>. Over the summer, I interned at <a href = "http://www3.gehealthcare.com/en" class = "link">GE</a>, where I built the web backend of a medical imaging app. Currently, I work as an iOS developer for a habit-building & crowdsourcing app in the <a href = "http://delta.northwestern.edu" class = "link">Delta Lab</a>.</p>

      <p class = "about">After I graduate, I'll take a one-way flight to San Francisco to build a beautiful reading and writing experience at <a href = "https://www.medium.com" class = "link">Medium</a> as a full-stack engineer.</p>

      <p class = "about">Still feeling like I'm an enigma? Check out my <a href = "" class = "link">talks</a>, <a href = "/#/shelf" class = "link">bookshelf</a> and <a href = "/#/mentions" class = "link">mentions</a> to learn more about me, and feel free to <a href = "mailto:alainakafkes@gmail.com" class = "link">beep me</a> if you want to reach me!</p>
