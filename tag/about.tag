      <p class = "about">I'm Alaina, a rising CS senior at <a href = "http://www.northwestern.edu/" class = "link">Northwestern University</a>.
      What gets me really excited is combining code & medicine, galvanizing women in tech, and tinkering with all things new.</p>
      <p class = "about">Currently, I'm the organizer for <a href = "http://eecs.northwestern.edu/wic/" class = "link">Women in Computing</a>, my female engineering family, and for <a href = "https://twitter.com/nu_buildher" class = "link">BuildHer</a>, Chicago's first-ever student-run women's hackathon.
      A little encouragement goes a long way, and I'm proud to say that my leadership has inspired many women at my university to keep coding.</p>
      <p class = "about">I toe the line between software engineering and R&D. I recently interned at <a href = "http://www3.gehealthcare.com/en" class = "link">GE Healthcare</a>, where I built the web backend of a medical imaging app. I launched <a href = "https://dibzmarket.com" class = "link">Dibz</a>, a short-term move-in/move-out start-up, in May.
        Now, I work as an iOS developer for a crowdsourcing app in the <a href = "http://delta.northwestern.edu" class = "link">Delta Lab</a>, and I research body image using novel hardware that I built in the <a href = "http://www.thehabitslab.com/" class = "link">HAbits Lab</a>.</p>
      <p class = "about">To learn more about me, read my story in <a href = "https://medium.com/@ReigningIt/women-who-reign-alaina-kafkes-7a5271e2a506#.eb15816s5" class = "link">Women Who Reign</a> or <a href = "https://medium.com/@lovestudentsintech/alaina-kafkes-students-in-tech-75a8abe0d324#.lnxwv679p" class = "link">Students in Tech</a>, and feel free to <a href = "mailto:alainakafkes2017@u.northwestern.edu" class = "link">drop a line</a> anytime! No seriously, I love meeting new people. What are you waiting for?</p>
