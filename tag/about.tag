      <p class = "about">Hi there! I'm Alaina. I just graduated <a href = "http://www.northwestern.edu/" class = "link">Northwestern University</a>, where I studied computer science and dabbled in other fun things like medicine and the humanities. Now, I'm kicking off my software engineering career at <a href = "https://medium.com" class = "link">Medium</a>.</p>

      <p class = "about">At Northwestern, I was best known for co-organizing <a href = "http://eecs.northwestern.edu/wic/" class = "link">Women in Computing</a>, co-founding <a href = "http://buildher.io/" class = "link">BuildHer</a>... and not understanding how to pronounce the word "corgi" (no joke).</p>
      <p class = "about">As a student, I coded cool things at <a href = "https://developer.clarifai.com/" class = "link">Clarifai</a>, <a href = "http://www3.gehealthcare.com/en" class = "link">GE</a>, and <a href = "http://delta.northwestern.edu" class = "link">Delta Lab</a>.</p>
      <p class = "title">The ~Real~ Me</p>
      <p class = "about">Surprise, surprise: I like things outside of tech, too! (Insert collective sigh of relief here.) Some things I enjoy are folding origami, <a href = "https://kafkesquartos.tumblr.com/" class = "link">voraciously reading</a>, and distance running.</p>
